## SQL Rockbuster Movie rental

Welcome to the DVD Rockbuster Video Store's GitHub repository! Within this repository, you will discover a compilation of SQL queries designed to assist you in the management and analysis of data associated with our movie rental business. Additionally, you will find a PDF document titled "RB_P_CF_FE" which provides an explanation of the findings. For a more comprehensive overview, please refer to the results available in the "RB_results" Excel file.

The project involved data from a fictional DVD rental service, including customer information, payment records, rental dates, and usage durations, to derive insights. Since the data was entirely fictional, and the scenario was somewhat contrived, no real insights could be uncovered. However, it served as an excellent exercise in utilizing various queries to generate an outcome that provided a solid understanding of the material.
